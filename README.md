Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a high possibility that the presence of certain
built environment characteristics can influence health outcomes, especially those related to obesity
and physical activity. We examined the associations between select neighborhood built environment
indicators (crosswalks, non-single family home buildings, single-lane roads, and visible wires), and
health outcomes, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality, at the
state level. We utilized 31,247,167 images collected from Google Street View to create indicators for
neighborhood built environment characteristics using deep learning techniques. Adjusted linear
regression models were used to estimate the associations between aggregated built environment
indicators and state-level health outcomes. Our results indicated that the presence of a crosswalk
was associated with reductions in obesity and premature mortality. Visible wires were associated
with increased obesity, decreased physical activity, and increases in premature mortality, diabetes
mortality, and cardiovascular mortality (however, these results were not significant). Non-single
family homes were associated with decreased diabetes and premature mortality, as well as increased
physical activity and park and recreational access. Single-lane roads were associated with increased
obesity and decreased park access. The findings of our study demonstrated that built environment
features may be associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes.
